## What is this?

It's a static blog/news template-driven site generator sans-javascript requirements and 
with minimal software library dependencies (written in C++ &#128150;).

It will produce a blog/news site whose navigation works just fine with js disabled at the 
cost of a bit of duplication in the HTML (that amount can range from minimal 
to hog-wild based on your requirements/options set). 

#### Who is it for?

If you:

* still enjoys crafting their website by hand-coding it old-school but just wish you
  could have an easier way to publish a blog next to it statically,

* are targeting a reader-base that runs a script blocker by default on their browser 
  (i.e.: security conscious types and anyone that can't stand ads and scroll wheel hijacking),
  
* are someone that just wants to keep things simple on your site

then keep reading.

#### Features:

* HTML5/CSS __only__ so works with JS disabled (e.g. with [NoScript](https://noscript.net/)),
* Template driven (offers some flexibility in design)
* Index generated by date and, optionally tags and/or authors,
* Master indices broken up into pages,
* Custom number of posts per page in the indices,
* Per-page navigation,
* Breadcrumbs (&#127838; nom nom nom),
* Optional post-specific custom stylesheets,
* Custom month strings for dates (to "localise" month names on the index),

#### Fair Warning

There is an expectation of a reasonable level of HTML/CSS proficiency from the operator as 
well as some debugging skills. The software will not sanitise/check your HTML/CSS.

## Configuration file

**File:** `blogator.cfg`

A default config file can be generated from the command line with `./blogator -c` in 
the root of the target site's root folder. //NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

> **Note:** all options keep to 1 line each and are terminated with a semi-colon `;`. 

#### General settings

    site-url       = "http://www.domain.com";
    canonify-urls  = false; //TODO 0: relative paths, 1: absolute paths with the site's URL as root, 
    log-file       = "";    //TODO Save path of the log file. If empty then no log file will be created

#### Templates

    template-change-paths = false;
    
> Switch to `true` if you are using working relative paths in the templates for development/preview 
  purposes. This will modify them based on the target html file location it is used to generate.
  Absolute paths (inc those that start with a `/`) will not be touched.

#### Month strings
    
    months = ["January", "February", "Mars", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

> Used on the tree indices on the post pages and indices. If it's not given or the array is not
  complete (12 strings for the 12 months), blogator will default to english names.

#### Posts
    
    build-future = false;
    
> Flag to enable inclusion of future dated posts in the build. Future means any time stamp whose day/month/year
is after the day of the build (i.e. when generator is run).

    safe-purge = true;
    
> Flag enabling deletion in the output post folder (`/posts`) of just html files (`*.htm` and 
  `*.html`) only whilst leaving any other file types and folders in the structure intact. 
  Good when resources are placed in there for whatever reasons and you don't want them to get 
  nuked during the built process.
    
#### Index

    show-post-numbers = true;
    
> Flag to enable the insertion of the post's publication number in the index entries.
    
    items-per-page = 10;
    
> Sets the Number of post entries per page in the index

    index-by-year = true;

> Flag to enable the creation of an extra index that groups posts by year

    index-by-tag = true;
    
> Flag to enable the creation of an extra index that groups posts by tags/categories
 
    index-by-author = true;
    
> Flag to enable the creation of an extra index that groups posts by authors

    summary-length = 200;   //TODO

> Number of characters for the summaries (taken from the first `<p class=summary></p>`
  inside the source posts). Set to `0` to disable completely. Note that there is a 
  substantial performance hit correlated with the number of posts to process. 

#### Page navigation
    
    page-nav-separator = " / ";
    page-nav-forward   = ">>";
    page-nav-backwards = "<<";
    page-nav-first     = "First";
    page-nav-last      = "Last";
    
> Used for the per-page navigation on the generated html. These strings will be copied verbatim
  into their respective `<a></a>` so custom html tags can be written inside these string values 
  for more flexibility. e.g.:  `page-nav-forward = "<div class="fwd-button"></div>";`
  
###### Note:

If a path is given in a nesting tag for one of the page navigation strings it must be an 
__absolute__ path for it to work across all generated pages.

#### Breadcrumb

    breadcrumb-landing-page   = "Welcome page";
    breadcrumb-by-date-page   = "Index";
    breadcrumb-by-year-page   = "Years";
    breadcrumb-by-tag-page    = "Categories";
    breadcrumb-by-author-page = "Authors";
    breadcrumb-index-page     = "Page ";
           
> Used for the breadcrumb navigation on the generated html. These strings will be copied verbatim
  into their respective `<a></a>` so custom html tags can be written inside these string values 
  if you want to get creative.  
  **e.g.:**  `breadcrumb-landing-page = "<img src="img/start.png" alt="landing page">";`
  
###### Note:

If a path is given in a nesting tag for one or more of breadcrumb strings it must be an 
__absolute__ path for it to work across all generated pages.
  
#### Landing page

    landing-most-recent = 5;
    
> Number of entries to the most recent posts/articles to place inside the `newest-posts` section 
  of the page. 

    landing-top-tags = 5;
    
> Top used tags in the posts/articles to display inside the `top-tags` section of the page. 
      
    landing-featured = ["0.html", "1.html", "2.html"];
    
> List of filenames of source posts to display inside the `featured-posts` section of the page. 

#### RSS feed
    
    rss             = true;
    rss-item-count  = 5;
    rss-title       = "My site";
    rss-description = "An awesome retro-futuristic site";
    rss-copyright   = "V 2077";
    rss-img-url     = "img/logo.svg";
    rss-img-link    = "http://www.domain.com/";
    rss-img-width   = "50px";
    rss-img-height  = "50px";
    rss-img-alt     = "Site logo";
   

## Support

#### Language/Character sets

As my original use-case for this software dealt with a site written in english, the 
implementation uses standard strings (`std::string`) and not wide character strings 
(`std::wstring`).

Officially only english is supported for the moment but your mileage in different 
languages/character sets may vary. I had no problem generating for a french language 
based site with all the wonderful `é` `ê` `è` `ç` types of characters that come with it. :)

**TL/DR: `UTF-8` should not pose a problem but `UTF-16` will.** 

`UTF-16` is something that might be supported in version `2.0` if it gets to that. I do not 
plan to deal with this for any `1.x` versions.

#### Platform

Officially, Linux and a compiler that supports C++17.

Note that I make heavy use of `std::filesystem` and some libraries 
might not have a complete implantation of that yet. `GCC 1.9.0` on 
Arch works fine for reference).

## Ideas for the future

Some ideas I've had for future versions of the software. May or may not happen depending on what 
I need most and what goes on in my life.
