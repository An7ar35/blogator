# BLOGATOR

Static blog/news site generator sans-javascript.

For those who prefer to hand-craft their site, think of JS as an extra rather 
than a necessity but still would like to keep a blog without the headache of 
indexing everything by hand.

#### Features:
* HTML5/CSS only so works with JS disabled,
* Index generated by date and tags,
* Per-page navigation,
* Custom per-post stylesheet link injection,
* Common Header/Footer for all posts,
* Custom month strings for dates (from a K,V pair file so can localise month names on the index)
