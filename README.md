# BLOGATOR

## What is this?

It's a static blog/news template-driven site generator sans-javascript requirements.

This is mainly aimed for a reader-base that runs a script blocker by default on their browser. 
Whether prompted by fatigue at the modern trend of websites that can only function with 
javascript or by security concerns, Blogator will produce a blog/news site whose navigation 
works just fine with js disabled at the cost of a bit of duplication in the HTML.

## Features:
* HTML5/CSS __only__ so works with JS disabled (e.g. with [NoScript](https://noscript.net/)),
* Template driven (offers some flexibility in design)
* Index generated by date and tags,
* Master indices broken up into pages,
* Custom number of posts per page in the indices,
* Per-page navigation,
* Optional post-specific custom stylesheets,
* Custom month strings for dates (from a K,V pair file so can localise month names on the index),
