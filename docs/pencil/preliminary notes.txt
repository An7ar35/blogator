Source material
===============
· File names are in order of publication
· HTML content is correct (tags are closed)
· CSS is already linked in header.html's head tags
· All posts have a <h1> heading, <span class="tag">..</span>, and <time timedate="YYY-MM-DD...">..</time>

· There can only be 1 Insertion tags per line in the templates
  "Template file must keep to 1 insertion tag per line. No more.*"
    "*If and when I get time in the future I might do something about continuous insertion points on a single line"
· Index entries are nested into a <a></a> tag that links back to the post

things you cannot do in the source posts/templates
· HTML Tag nesting in source and injection points. keep it clean
· multi-line, multi-classed blogator source tags in source posts
· Unclosed tags

Character codes (like HTML emojis/UTF greek...) are copied properly but wide character support is not at the moment. I.e.:
As long as the character codes are used it should output to the generated files properly.
Officially support is for English. Unofficially, I'm happy to receive sample html files with different character sets and if/when
I get some time I'll look into expanding support for these. As this project is mostly for helping me with a side-gig and my personal
website it was not a priority during development.
· Each author must be in its own <span class="author"></span> tag. An author tag must be opened and closed on the same line.

*_entry.html -> put summary in a <p></p> and whatever is inside will be copied into any index/landing/rss description (summary)

Running the generator
=====================
· MAX number of item in master indices per page is passed to application (or default to 10)
· HTML source is copied verbatim and then collated/edited where necessary (links)
· Index pane orders dates in descending order
· Index pane orders tags in alphabetical order

Future
======
· Add JS extension for page navigation ('select' box for page numbers?) that can work when JS is available?
· Use collation (http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/api) for sorting in the future along with wstring?
