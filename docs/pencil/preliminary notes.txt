//TODO
======
· Find/replace tags inside any <span class="tag">..</span> with hyperlinked versions (<a></a>)
· Testing with emojis and weird char sets (accents, etc..) and check insert points still work as well as ordering in the index (tag names)

Source material
===============
· File names are in order of publication
· HTML content is correct (tags are closed)
· Header:
    -> open <body> and <html>
· Footer:
    -> closing </body> and </html>
· CSS is already linked in header.html's head tags
· All posts have a <h1> heading, <span class="tag">..</span>, and <time timedate="YYY-MM-DD...">..</time>

· There can only be 1 Insertion tags per line in the templates
  "Template file must keep to 1 insertion tag per line. No more.*"
    "*If and when I get time in the future I might do something about continuous insertion points on a single line"
· Index entries are nested into a <a></a> tag that links back to the post


Running the generator
=====================
· MAX number of item in master indices per page is passed to application (or default to 10)
· HTML source is copied verbatim and then collated/edited where necessary (links)
· Index pane orders dates in descending order
· Index pane orders tags in alphabetical order


Notes
=====
Tags for page-per-page navigation:
    <a rel="prev" href=""></a>
    <a rel="next" href=""></a>



Future
======
· Add JS extension for page navigation ('select' box for page numbers?) that can work when JS is available?
· Use collation (http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/api) for sorting in the future along with wstring?
· RSS articles: <description>, <guid>
