//TODO
======
· Find/replace tags inside any <span class="tag">..</span> with hyperlinked versions (<a></a>)
· Testing with emojis and weird char sets (accents, etc..) and check insert points still work as well as ordering in the index (tag names)
· Have the readers optionally work with RegEx in cases where multiple tags sources are on the same line //TEST this assumptions?

Source material
===============
· File names are in order of publication
· HTML content is correct (tags are closed)
· Header:
    -> open <body> and <html>
· Footer:
    -> closing </body> and </html>
· CSS is already linked in header.html's head tags
· All posts have a <h1> heading, <span class="tag">..</span>, and <time timedate="YYY-MM-DD...">..</time>

· There can only be 1 Insertion tags per line in the templates
  "Template file must keep to 1 insertion tag per line. No more.*"
    "*If and when I get time in the future I might do something about continuous insertion points on a single line"
· Index entries are nested into a <a></a> tag that links back to the post

things you cannot do in the source posts/templates
· HTML Tag nesting in source and injection points. keep it clean
· multi-line, multi-classed blogator source tags in source posts
· Unclosed tags

Character codes (like HTML emojis/UTF greek...) are copied properly but wide character support is not at the moment. I.e.:
As long as the character codes are used it should output to the generated files properly.
Officially support is for English. Unoficially, I'm happy to recieve smaple html files with differnet character sets and if/when
I get some time I'll look into expandin gsupport for these. As this project is mostly for helping me with a side-gig and my personal
website it was not a priority during development.
· Each author must be in its own <span class="author"></span> tag. An author tag must be opened and closed on the same line.

*_entry.html -> put summary in a <p></p> and whatever is inside will be copied into any index/landing/rss description (summary)

Running the generator
=====================
· MAX number of item in master indices per page is passed to application (or default to 10)
· HTML source is copied verbatim and then collated/edited where necessary (links)
· Index pane orders dates in descending order
· Index pane orders tags in alphabetical order


Notes
=====
Tags for page-per-page navigation:
    <a rel="prev" href=""></a>
    <a rel="next" href=""></a>



Future
======
· Add JS extension for page navigation ('select' box for page numbers?) that can work when JS is available?
· Use collation (http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/api) for sorting in the future along with wstring?
· RSS articles: <description>, <guid>
· Index/Landing page entries <description> support (first n lines with '...' added?, special summary file?, optional summary comment line in source post?)
· Index by_author -> will need multi author tag detection
· replace template paths (assumed to be correct from where they are) to relative to generated target post/index?
· *_index.html class 'description' class tag search and use in index item /start page item?
  OR text taken in <p> tags in article source with n char length ('summary-length')
