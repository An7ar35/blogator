· [LINK/PATHS] Perhaps add special blogator tags like "{DATE-LIST-PAGE}", "{DATE-LATEST-PAGE}" and such as an injector option in href/src stuff?
          Could be a cool way to inject up-to-date paths into links when generated files my not always have to the same names on every generation run
          -> might need a special option like "blogator-tags = true" in the cfg file to enable that search?


· [SUMMARY] Index/Landing page entries <description> support
            (first n lines with '...' added?, special summary file?, optional summary comment line in source post?)
· [SUMMARY] *_entry.html  class="summary" tag search and use in index item /start page item?
            OR text taken in <p> tags in article source with n char length ('summary-length')

· RSS articles: <description>, <guid> (requires the 'summary' functionality to be implemented through)

//TODO
======
· Have the readers optionally work with RegEx in cases where multiple tags sources are on the same line //TEST this assumptions?
· !!! when display.begin(..) check whether the last job batch was completed properly and msg + reset line appropriatly
