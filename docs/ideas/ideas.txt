· [SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTER] Syntax highlighter for code snippets
        -> Optional regex override from a string in the config file? if fail then fall back on default and print error msg + message for switching to default
        -> Read at the same time as the summary in each posts
        -> snippets could be stored in temp file in the temp folder?
           "{n}_{i}_code.html" where 'n' is the article number and 'i' is the snippet number (in order)

· [RSS] RSS articles: <guid> (will need any summary rel paths to be canonified to the site's root address)

· [LINK/PATHS] Perhaps add special blogator tags like "{DATE-LIST-PAGE}", "{DATE-LATEST-PAGE}" and such as an injector option in href/src stuff?
        Could be a cool way to inject up-to-date paths into links when generated files my not always have to the same names on every generation run
        -> might need a special option like "blogator-tags = true" in the cfg file to enable that search?

· [TAGS/CATS] Optional icon injector instead of tag names? Could also do a template in blogator.cfg like: 'display-tags= "<div>{NAME}{ICONS}</div>"'
· [POST TITLES] Have a optional struct like '<div class="title-struct"></div>"' that can be used in indices and landing page entries where an entire html structure can be
    used instead of just a plain title.

· [HYPERLINK] Cross post hyperlink recognition during build and adaptation based on output index;

//TODO redo the folder structure diagram (pencil) to reflect all the changes

blogator-tags  = false; //TODO special tag->relative path replacer based on certain key pages expressed in {TAG} form (e.g.: "{DATE-LATEST-PAGE}"
canonify-urls  = false; //TODO true: modify all relative URLs found in the posts/templates to absolute paths with the site's URL as root,

· Hash & cache articles. Then check hash on run to make sure article hasn't been changed

· Index page for local files (e.g.: *.pdf)
· Updated page hook for the front page as an option (i.e. when a post is updated the article can appear in an "recently updated section" for the frontpage)
