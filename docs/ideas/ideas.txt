· [LINK/PATHS] adapt 'href' and 'src' from template location's relative paths to target location's relative paths
        > if template file is in '/templates/index/' and it's target location is '/index/' then
          an href="../../pages/page.html" will become href="../pages/page.html"

        > NOTE: make it only work if href/src path is either relative or it's root is the website URL
                Also, the paths need to be assumed correct from where they are
                -> do a target file/path check to sanitise the sources before generating everything?

        > This would allow for template preview will all the hyperlinks and css sources working and the
          target's generation without having to manually change the paths prior
          
    -->Regular expresion for that shoudl be fine as limited to just the templates

· [SUMMARY] Index/Landing page entries <description> support
  (first n lines with '...' added?, special summary file?, optional summary comment line in source post?)
· [SUMMARY] *_entry.html  class="summary" tag search and use in index item /start page item?
  OR text taken in <p> tags in article source with n char length ('summary-length')
