路 [INDEXING] Would hoovering the entire post into a string then using regex be faster?

路 [SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTER] Syntax highlighter for code snippets
        -> Optional regex override from a string in the config file? if fail then fall back on default and print error msg + message for switching to default
        -> Read at the same time as the summary in each posts
        -> snippets could be stored in temp file in the temp folder?
           "{n}_{i}_code.html" where 'n' is the article number and 'i' is the snippet number (in order)

路 [RSS] RSS articles: <description>, <guid> (requires the 'summary' functionality to be implemented through)

路 [LINK/PATHS] Perhaps add special blogator tags like "{DATE-LIST-PAGE}", "{DATE-LATEST-PAGE}" and such as an injector option in href/src stuff?
        Could be a cool way to inject up-to-date paths into links when generated files my not always have to the same names on every generation run
        -> might need a special option like "blogator-tags = true" in the cfg file to enable that search?



//TODO redo the folder structure diagram (pencil) to reflect all the changes

blogator-tags  = false; //TODO special tag->relative path replacer based on certain key pages expressed in {TAG} form (e.g.: "{DATE-LATEST-PAGE}"
canonify-urls  = false; //TODO true: modify all relative URLs found in the posts/templates to absolute paths with the site's URL as root,
